# ini-reader

Our .ini reader, used to read values in to the code and to read autonomous code.

Archived versions of iniReader are in `2015-archive` and `2016-archive`. `master` needs to be tested before it should be used in projects.

See [this](https://github.com/first-team-1699/ini-reader/wiki/introduction) for usage.

# Side Note

Please report any bugs, even if you could tell me in person. Most bugs can be patched rather easily and quickly.

And please request more things to put in this tutorial.
