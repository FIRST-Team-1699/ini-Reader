# ini-Reader

Our .ini reader, used in many projects over many years, since 2011.

Archived versions of iniReader are in `2015-archive` and `2016-archive`. `master` is a beta and should *NOT* be used in a competitive robot until a semi-stable release is finished.

# Usage

This version of ini-Reader sticks to the "definition" for ini files. The syntax can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file).

This will be updated later, when I have time. But there's sections and lines and files.

# One Last Note

Please report any bugs, even if you could tell me in person. Most bugs can be patched rather easily and quickly.
