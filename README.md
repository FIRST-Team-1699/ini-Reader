# ini-Reader

Our .ini reader, used in many projects over many years, since 2011. 

Archived versions of iniReader are in `2015-archive` and `2016-archive`. `master` is a beta and should *NOT* be used in a competitive robot until a semi-stable release is finished. 

# Usage

Changing in this update. Documentation will be done last.

# One Last Note

Please report any bugs, even if you could tell me in person. Most bugs can be patched rather easily and quickly.
